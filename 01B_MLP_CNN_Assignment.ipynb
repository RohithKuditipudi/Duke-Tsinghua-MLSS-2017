For more difficult optimization spaces (such as the ones deep networks pose), we might want to use more sophisticated algorithms. Prof David Carlson has a lecture on this later.\n",

This let's us see how our model is doing during the training process, rather than sit around twiddling our thumbs and hoping for the best when training finishes. This becomes especially significant as training regimens start approaching days and weeks in length. Normally, we validate on the entire validation set, but for the sake of time we'll just stick to 10 validation minibatches (500 images) for this homework assignment."

I'd use a shallow MLP for simple tasks, or when the properties of a CNN don't help me (e.g. I don't care about translation invariance if I'm working in OpenAI gym and my input is a state vector, not raw pixels).\n",

I would expect to achieve better results with a CNN on ImageNet than I would with an MLP. One reason why CNNs scale better than MLPs is that the CNN architecture is specifically designed to leverage prior domain knowledge about images/object detection (e.g. translation invariance). Because of tricks like parameter sharing employed by CNNs, an MLP would likely require a lot more parameters to achieve comparable performance with a CNN.\n",
